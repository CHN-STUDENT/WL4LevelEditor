# WL4LevelEditor
# 
### This is the new version of Wario Land 4 Editor after my repo(https://github.com/shinespeciall/WarioLand4MultiEditor), I want to use only Qt for supporting more platforms. This repo is in its early time, it needs time to arrange useful data I found in WL4 ROM file into classes and extract all the Tile Data and some other things from source ROM data to make the new software a pure things without the support of the source ROM file and only make data file for the next-step injection/patching.
## 
### my brand-new Discord channel(use this to get in: https://discord.gg/easnNyB) welcome all the WL4 fans who get interested in Qt coding for this software and those who are willing to make new levels and share them.
